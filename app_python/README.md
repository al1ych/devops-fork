# What Time Is It In Moscow? (WTIIIM?)

![ci badge](https://github.com/al1ych/devops-fork/actions/workflows/python_workflow.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

    Have you ever thought to yourself: "Man, only if I knew what time it is right now"?

    Well, now you can!
    Just visit our amazing cutting-edge web-site. 
    With this application you will always know what time it is!

    Built by time watchers for time watchers!

    P. S. This is an MVP, so you can only watch MSK time at the moment.

### Stack:

- Python
- Flask

## Build

### Prerequisites:

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) (other version will probably work fine as well)
- clone this repo

### To run the server:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `flask run --port=8081`

## Usage

Once you've started the server

To see the web page, navigate to http://localhost:8081 in your browser

If you want to change the ip address and/or the port, you can do it in `config.yml`:

## Docker

I containerized this application and uploaded the final image to the docker hub.

The application runs on port 8081 (by default), so you should forward this port when running

I've looked at multi-staging and believe it's unnecessary for a project this size.

### Prerequisites:

1. [Download docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Install it

### Build from local image:

`cd app_python/`

`docker build -t wtiiim_app .`

`docker run -p 8081:8081 -d wtiiim_app`

[//]: # (docker run -p 8081:8081 -d wtiiim_app)
[//]: # (docker push aladdinych/devops_labs)

### Build from docker hub:

`docker pull aladdinych/devops_labs`

`docker run -p 8081:8081 -d aladdinych/devops_labs`

## Testing

### Unit tests

I chose Pytest for testing as it's more popular and easier to use than unittest.

Run 'python3 -m pytest tests/' to start the tests.

- gets current time for Moscow timezone

This test checks that if someone changes the algorithm of obtaining the current time,
the implementation will give the same result as the implementation we have in the first iteration
(e.g. the correct result). It is checking that we obtain the current time for Moscow timezone with en-US with
the locale parameter set to en-US.

- gets current time for Chicago timezone

We need this test because in the business requirements it's stated that our incredibly popular app will
extend outside the Russian market into the US market, so we need to be ready to have support for the US time,
specifically, Chicago timezone. So we have to always check (with a test) that
we're getting correct results for Chicago timezone as well.

- gets correct home route

As we currently have only one route (home, '/'), we have only one test for one endpoint.
This test checks if we successfully retrieved the home page.

# What Time Is It In Moscow? (WTIIIM?)

## Overview

    Have you ever thought to yourself: "Man, only if I knew what time it is right now"?

    Well, now you can!
    Just visit our amazing cutting-edge web-site. 
    With this application you will always know what time it is!

    Built by time watchers for time watchers!

    P. S. This is an MVP, so you can only watch MSK time at the moment.

### Stack:

- Python
- Flask

## Build

### Prerequisites:

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) (other version will probably work fine as well)
- clone this repo

### To run the server:

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `flask run --port=8081`

## Usage

Once you've started the server

To see the web page, navigate to http://localhost:8081 in your browser

If you want to change the ip address and/or the port, you can do it in `config.yml`:

## Docker

I containerized this application and uploaded the final image to the docker hub.

The application runs on port 8081 (by default), so you should forward this port when running

I've looked at multi-staging and believe it's unnecessary for a project this size.

### Prerequisites:

1. [Download docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Install it

### Build from local image:

`cd app_python/`

`docker build -t wtiiim_app .`

`docker run -p 8081:8081 -d wtiiim_app`

### Build from docker hub:

`docker pull aladdinych/devops_labs`

`docker run -p 8081:8081 -d aladdinych/devops_labs`

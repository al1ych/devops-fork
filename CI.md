# Best practices applied:

1. **Commit early, commit often.**
2. **Keep the builds green.** By building the solution and running a set of
automated tests each time a change is committed, a CI/CD pipeline
provides rapid feedback to developers about their changes.
3. **Clean your environments.**
4. **Monitor and measure your pipeline.** Alert about troubles with CI.
5. Include **Snyk** for automatic vulnerability checking.
6. **Do not hardcode secrets.**

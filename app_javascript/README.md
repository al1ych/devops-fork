## Docker

I containerized this application and uploaded the final image to the docker hub.

The application runs on port 8082 (by default), so you should forward this port when running.

I've looked at multi-staging and believe it's unnecessary for a project this size.

### Prerequisites:

1. [Download docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Install it

### Build from local image:

`cd app_javascript/`

`docker build -t wtiiim_app_js .`

`docker run -p 8082:8082 -d wtiiim_app_js`

### Build from docker hub:

`docker pull aladdinych/devops_labs_js`

`docker run -p 8082:8082 -d aladdinych/devops_labs_js`
